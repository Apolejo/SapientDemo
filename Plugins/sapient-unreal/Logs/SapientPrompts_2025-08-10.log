[00:02:37] Sapient:
 I'm Sapient, your AI-powered assistant for Unreal Engine 5.4+, here to accelerate gameplay mechanics development. As a "project-aware" assistant, I understand your game, enabling me to support your mechanics development workflow—from generating fresh gameplay variations to implementing entire systems, troubleshooting, and optimizing—helping you find the fun faster.


Here's how I can help:

1. 🛠️ **UE5 Assistant** – Navigate your project with intelligent file search, dependency tracing, diagnostics, and UE5 feature integration best practices.

2. 💻 **Code Copilot** – Assist with building, refactoring, debugging, and analyzing C++ code, ensuring it follows your game's architecture and guidelines.

3. 🔹 **Asset Copilot** – Assist with building, refactoring, debugging, and analyzing gameplay logic and AI using UE5's visual scripting.


Tips for Working with Me:

1. **Provide context** – The more I know about your goal, the better I can help. Start with what you're trying to build before giving instructions.

2. **Be specific** – Think of me like a teammate. Clear, direct instructions work best.

3. **Reference key files and asset names** – I can search your project, but if you know relevant classes, files, or assets, let me know! Use the '@' key to add specific assets and files to your request. The more you give, the less i have to search.

4. **Access past chats** – You can find conversation history in the "Logs" folder of your sapient-unreal plugin.


Asset Capabilities:

- **Read & Understand** – Blueprints, Animation Blueprints, Widget Blueprints, Behavior Trees, Blackboards, Data Tables, Structs, Enums, and Materials
- **Create & Modify** (Experimental) – Blueprints, Behavior Trees, Blackboards, and Enums
